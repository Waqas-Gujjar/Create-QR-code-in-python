# Create QR Code in Python

This project demonstrates how to create a QR code in Python using the `qrcode` library and the `PIL` library for image processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- qrcode
- Pillow

## Installation

First, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this using `pip`:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

To create a QR code with a custom URL, you can use the following script:

```python
import qrcode
from PIL import Image

# Create instance of QRCode
qr = qrcode.QRCode(
    version=1,
    error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_H,
    box_size=10,
    border=4,
)

# Add data to the instance
qr.add_data("https://github.com/Waqas-Gujjar/Create-QR-code-in-python")
qr.make(fit=True)

# Create an image from the QR Code instance
img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="lightgray")

# Save the image
img.save("GitHub.png")
```

This script will generate a QR code with the specified URL, fill color, and background color, and then save it as `GitHub.png`.
